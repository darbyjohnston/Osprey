Overview
========
Osprey is an open source plugin that integrates the OSPRay renderer with
the Rhino 3D modeler. OSPRay is an "open source, scalable, and portable ray
tracing engine for high-performance, high-fidelity visualization on Intel
Architecture CPUs."

Intel OSPRay: https://www.ospray.org/

This plugin is in the early stages of development and is currently only released
as source code.

### NYC
These scenes are from data sets of New York City provided by BYTES of the BIG
APPLE:
https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-nyc-3d-model-download.page

The scene MN01 consists of 132255 model components with a file size of about
350MB:
https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/zip/data-maps/open-data/nyc-3d-model/nyc_3dmodel_mn01.zip

The scene MN08 consists of 366474 model components with a file size of about
950MB:
https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/zip/data-maps/open-data/nyc-3d-model/nyc_3dmodel_mn08.zip

The scenes were opened in Rhino and modified with the following:
* Added a sun
* Added a ground plane
* Added a new material for the buildings
* Enabled the skylight with an intensity of 0.3 and the default custom environment
* Enabled curve rendering
* Set the render gamma to 2.2 and enabled the linear workflow
* Set the backdrop to the solid color: 65, 100, 170

OSPRay renderer settings:
* Resolution: 1920x1080
* Passes: 8
* Pixel samples: 1

Building the Plugin
===================
Requirements:
* Visual Studio 2017
* Rhino 6 SDK - https://www.rhino3d.com/download/Rhino-SDK/6.0/release
* Git - https://git-scm.com/
* CMake - https://cmake.org/

#### Building OSPRay
Open a Visual Studio 2017 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt. Choose a directory
and clone the repository:
```
> git clone https://github.com/ospray/ospray.git
```

Create a directory for the build and run CMake:
```
> mkdir ospray-build
> cd ospray-build
> cmake ../ospray/scripts/superbuild -G "NMake Makefiles" -DINSTALL_IN_SEPARATE_DIRECTORIES=FALSE -DBUILD_OIDN=TRUE -DBUILD_OIDN_FROM_SOURCE=TRUE
```

Start the build:
```
> nmake
```

After the build is finished OSPRay will be installed in the "install"
sub-directory.

Open the control panel and add a new environment variable called
"OSPRAY_INSTALL". Set the value to the full path of the "install" sub-directory.

#### Building Osprey
Open a Visual Studio 2017 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt. Choose a directory
and clone the repository:
```
> git clone https://github.com/darbyjohnston/Osprey/Osprey.git
```

Open the "Osprey.sln" file with Visual Studio 2017 and start debugging. When the
build has finished Rhino will start automatically.

Install the Osprey plugin from the menu "Tools/Options...". The plugin is named
"Osprey.rhp" and is located in the sub-directory "x64\Debug" or "x64\Release"
depending on your build configuration. Note that if you change the build
configuration you will need to reinstall the plugin.
